This repository contains a project aimed at demonstrating text processing capabilities using Azure Functions and Durable Functions, showcasing how to build a serverless application that handles text transformation and analysis.

Key Components
Reverse and Uppercase Function:

Purpose: This function is designed to take an input string, reverse the characters, and then convert the entire string to uppercase. This is a simple example of a text transformation function that could be part of a larger text processing pipeline.
Structure: The function likely includes a handler for HTTP requests, logic to perform the string manipulation, and an output that sends the transformed text back to the caller.
Word Count Function:

Purpose: This function counts the number of words in the input text. It serves as an example of text analysis, which is another common operation in text processing tasks.
Structure: Similar to the reverse and uppercase function, it would include a handler to accept input text, logic to count words, and an output mechanism to return the result.
Text Processing Orchestrator:

Purpose: The orchestrator function, implemented using Azure Durable Functions, manages the flow of the entire text processing operation. It coordinates the execution of the other functions (e.g., calling the reverse and uppercase function first, then passing the result to the word count function).
Structure: This component handles the workflow logic, ensuring that the functions are executed in the correct sequence and that their outputs are correctly managed and passed between steps.
Supporting Files and Configuration
.funcignore and .gitignore: These files help manage the files that should be excluded during deployment and version control respectively. The .funcignore file is specific to Azure Functions, ensuring that unnecessary files are not included in the deployment package, while .gitignore prevents certain files from being tracked in the Git repository.

host.json: This file is part of the Azure Functions configuration and is used to define runtime settings such as logging levels, timeouts, and other function app behaviors.

requirements.txt: This file lists the Python dependencies required for the functions in the project. It ensures that the correct versions of libraries are installed when setting up the environment or deploying the functions.

Multimedia Files
Recorded Video Files (23.08.2024_17.04.05_REC.mp4 and 23.08.2024_17.11.36_REC.mp4): These videos might contain demonstrations or tutorials related to the project. They could showcase the setup, deployment process, or live demonstrations of the text processing functions in action.
